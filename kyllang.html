    <h5>Kyllang Rock
This is a peculiar rock located in Nongkhlaw north of Mairang town in the West Khasi Hills District. In local folklore it was the brother of Symper rock standing in Weiloi near Mawsynram. Another folklore talks about a Man, his wife and child, due to certain circumstances transformed into one whole rock.

The top of the Rock can be reached by stairs and gives a wonderful view of the surrounding areas. This rock needs to be promoted more.<p>
