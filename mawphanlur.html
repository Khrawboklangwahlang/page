Review of Mawphanlur Traveller’s Nest<p>

We stayed in Mawphanlur guest house run by Transis Syiemlieh (simple and nice person) in May 2018. It is part of the 7 co-operatives encouraged by Meghalaya state govt. as rural tourism. The village is very beautiful, windy and surroundings are truly heavenly - the place proves the coinage - Scotland of the East. Facilities are basic as in any remote and rural places. A visit to Nongkhnum island from here is more than rewarding.<br />
<b><i>A bit of paradise off the beaten path</i></b><p>
Secluded, quiet, serene. Away from the crowd, Mawphanlur is a great place for disconnecting from the stress of life in the concrete jungle. This place is managed and run by a village cooperative that supports 25 families. Gentle rolling hills and water bodies make this place an idyllic paradise for families, couples and friends looking for a peaceful time away from everyday life. This place has 3/4 cottages only and they get booked quickly, so contact Trancis and make advance payment early to book them.<p>

The people here are very simple, honest and kind. Please respect their ways and help keep the area clean by not throwing away plastics, liquor bottles and chicken feather all over the place. The local folks have limited resources to clean up such a huge area.<p>

<b>Tips:</b><p>
1. A huge swarm of people was there on Republic Day. If you want peace and tranquility, avoid such public holidays<p>
2. During cole months (December, January) ask room service to provide charcoal stove for room heating. Voltage is low during evening and electric heater is ineffective.<p>
	To reach here, one need to park their vehicle at Markasa, as only a Jeep can navigate further to Mawphanlur due to the pathetic road ahead!! Transis and his family is extremely warm and welcoming. They have 2 cottages as of now and another one is being built. There’s pretty much nothing to do at Mawphanlur except to enjoy the serene beauty of the place lying in the map of mother nature. Otherwise one can choose to do boating or Kayaking at the high hill lakes which is arranged by the guys there at the Traveller’s Nest only. The rooms and the place is very clean and extremely well maintained.
